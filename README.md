# MoreSenseViewer

View sensor data from .csv log files as graphs!

For everyone who has a MoreSense CO₂/particle sensor and wants to visualise the data in the .CSV log files generated by the MoreSense device.

## Why this project

When you want to check if the CO₂ levels were good at night, or if the heat pump was working well, or if the PM2.5 levels were high when you were cooking, you can't really do that with the MoreSense device by itself. You can only see the current values. This project allows you to visualise the data in the .CSV log files generated by the MoreSense device.

Another option is to use home automation software - Home Assistant, Domoticz, etc. but I found those a few years ago to be too much hassle.
